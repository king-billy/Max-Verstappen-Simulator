# Max-Verstappen-Simulator
Hahaha Red Bull F1 car go brrrr (Happy Adrian Newey noises)




Formula 1 is getting boring, let's be real here. I can only watch so much of Max Verstappen winning every race.
I got bored and thought I'd make something to figure out how long I need to tune my brain out during races. This is still a work in progress, I need to implement a better regression model that predicts how early some driver could win the season (some driver=Max Verstappen, cuz let's be honest no one else is winning). I plan to continue this for future seasons (obviously I would need to create a much more in depth model for that, and I can only do that after the Pre Season Testing concludes in later season). This would purely depend on how much data each team puts out for a season, not to mention changes right after the testing, moving into the first race *cough* Mercedes W13 *cough*.

This is only for shits and giggles, I was bored and this is the minimal amount of brain power I could contribute to this.
