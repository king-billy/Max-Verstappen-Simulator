# Max-Verstappen-Simulator
Hahaha Red Bull F1 car go brrrr (Happy Adrian Newey noises)




Formula 1 is getting boring, let's be real here. I can only watch so much of Max Verstappen winning every race.
I got bored and thought I'd make something to figure out how long I need to tune my brain out during races. This is still a work in progress, I need to implement a better regression model that predicts how early some driver could win the season (some driver=Max Verstappen, cuz let's be honest no one else is winning). I plan to continue this for future seasons (obviously I would need to create a much more in depth model for that, and I can only do that after the Pre Season Testing concludes in later season). This would purely depend on how much data each team puts out for a season, not to mention changes right after the testing, moving into the first race *cough* Mercedes W13 *cough*.

This is only for shits and giggles, I was bored and this is the minimal amount of brain power I could contribute to this.


If you wanna try it out, run Max Verstappen Dominance.py (the model spits out a mid to late mid season race, cuz the model is kinda reasonable rn. I'm gonna train it better to account for the sheer dump Red Bull and Max are taking on the entire motor racing scene at the moment (LIKE WHO WINS A RACE A WHOLE HALF A MINUTE AHEAD OF THE P2 WTF, BRO JUST SETS THE FASTEST LAP CUZ HE GETS BORED RACING GODDAMN).
